**I. Introduction**

How did the style of play and performance of football club Manchester City change after the appointment of their current manager, Pep Guardiola? Pep Guardiola is one of the greatest tactical masterminds of modern football. He is a coach who possesses all the skills and experience to transform any team into a dominating champion in any worldwide competition. As a manager, he holds the record for the most consecutive league games won in La Liga, the Bundesliga and the Premier League. Guardiola has managed to win a total of 30 trophies in his career as a manager of Barcelona, Bayern Munich, and Manchester City. 

The purpose of this study is to perform a comparative analysis of the style of play and performance of the football club Manchester City before and after the appointment of Pep Guardiola. We will evaluate data from the 2013-2014 season through the 2018-2019 season. During the first three seasons (2013-2014, 2014-2015, 2015-2016), Manuel Pellegrini was manager of Manchester City and managed to win one Premier League title. During the following three seasons (2016-2017, 2017-2018, 2018-2019), Pep Guardiola was appointed as manager and was expected at the time of the announcement to completely change Manchester City's style of play with his world famous Tika-Taka style.

In order to answer our primary research question, we aim to explore the following secondary research questions:

· How did Manchester City perform offensively over the seasons?
· How did Manchester City perform defensively over the seasons?

· How did Manchester City perform against the bottom-half of the table compared to the top-half of the table over the season? 

· How did Manchester City perform during Pellegrini's time as a manager compared to Guardiola's time as a manager?

As football players and fans, we admire Guardiola's style of play and the way he transforms a team to become dominating force in their league. In the documentary 'All or Nothing: Manchester City', it is crystal clear that Guardiola has an remarkable obsession for soccer and the style of play of his team. Everything Guardiola does stems from his almost pathological attention to detail. As football players, we believe that small details can make the difference needed to crown a team champion at the end of the season and are motivated to get a better understanding of these details through this analysis. 

This study is divided into six additional sections. The next section includes a biography of Pep Guardiola as professional football player and as coach. We will then present Guardiola's style of play at Manchester City and how it has changed over the seasons. We will then introduce our data before analyzing the results in the next section of this study. In the sixth section, we will summarize our findings and provide the limitations and future research poissibilities as an extension of this study. In the last seciton, we will display a bibliography.

**II. Pep Guardiola**

Guardiola spent the majority of his career as a defensive midfielder for Barcelona. Johan Cruyff transformed Barcelona with Guardiola in a central role into a celebrated champion as they won the club's first European Cup in 1992 and four La Liga titles from 1991 to 1994. He also captained Barcelona from 1997 until his departure from Bareclona in 2001. He played 47 caps for the Spanish national team, and was part of the team at the 1994 World Cup and Euro 2000. After his retirement as player, he became coach of Barcelona B and after being appointed as manager of Barcelona's first team in May 2008. Guardiola immediately transformed the Barcelona team by telling key players Ronaldinho, Deco, Samuel Eto'o, and others that they wouldn't be part of his plans. He then signed Dani Ales and Gerard Piqué, while he promoted Sergio Busquets and Pedro to his team. These players would later be key to the team that dominated modern football for years. In his first season at Barcelona, he guided the team to the treble of La Liga, La Copa del Rey, and the UEFA Champions League, making him the youngest manager to ever accomplish this. When he left the club, he had won 14 honours as manager of Barcelona, a historical club record.

After a short sabbatical and an intensive German language course, Guardiola was announced as the new manager of Bayern Munich in 2013. During his time at one of the greatest clubs in the history of football, Guardiola won the Bundesliga in three consecutive seasons, including two domestic doubles. 

While Guardiola won a domestic double in his final year at Bayern Munich in 2016, Manchester City only managed to seal the fourth place in the English Premier League that season. The fourth place in the table qualified them for a spot in next year's Champions League. In February of that year, Manchester City announced the appointment of Pep Guardiola for Manchester City's upcoming season. Many blame the downfall of Manchester City during that season and the failure of Pelligrini during his final season on the mid-season announcement of Guardiola's arrival. Before Pep's arrival was announced, Manchester City were only three points short on the first place in the Premier League. At the end of the season, they finished 15 points apart from champion Leicester City and only just qualified for the group stage of the Champions League. During Pellegrini's years at Manchester City from 2013 to 2016, he managed to win one Premier League title and two League Cups.

During Guardiola's first year as a Manchester City manager, he signed critical players, such as Oleksandr Zinchenko, Leroy Sané, İlkay Gündoğan, Claudio Bravo, and Gabriel Jesus. Guardiola is known for transforming the playing style of any new team he manages which requires critical signings that fit into his style of play. During a disappointing 2016-2017 season at Manchester City, Guardiola did not manage to win any trophies. However, Guardiola was able to identify the necessary changes to improve team in the battle for the Premier League title in the 2017-2018 season. He was able to make three acquisitions in the summer transfer window, goalkeeper Ederson Moraes, midfielder Bernardo Silva, as well as full-backs Danilo, Benjamin Mendy, and Kyle Walker, while dropping all four senior full backs from the team. The Manchester City squad had the fourth highest average squad age in the entire Premier League during the 2016-2017 season, which explains some of Guardiola's challenges during his first season. The signings in the lead up to the 2017-2018 season made Manchester City the 6th youngest squad in the league. 

In the weeks leading up to the final part of the 2017-2018 season, Guardiola had managed to put Manchester City into a position to break historical records in the Premier League. On 15 April 2018, Manchester City had officially won the Premier League with most wins (32) in Premier League history, most away wins (16) in Premier League history, most points (100) in Premier League history, most goals (106) in Premier League history. A historical Premier League title for Manchester City and the first for Guardiola in England. Manchester City also managed to win the EFL Cup with a 3-0 victory over Arsenal. However, they did not manage to qualify for the semifinal of the Champions League after losing against Liverpool in both legs of the quarterfinal. 

During Guardiola's third season as manager, he signed attacking midfielder Riyad Mahrez from Leicester City for a fee of £60 million. Manchester City had become accustomed to Guardiola's style of play and dominated the Premier League in the previous season. They immediately started their season with a prize, the 2018 FA Community Shield on August 5 with a victory over Chelsea. In the 2018-2019 season, Guardiola faced one of his biggest challenges as a manager of Manchester City, In order to win the title, Manchester City had to win 14 games in a row. Guardiola called it one of the toughest challenges in all his career. However, after 38 games, Manchester City was on top of the league with 98 points, one point above Liverpool. Another season with 32 wins and a respective 95 goals scored. Besides the FA Community Shield and Premier League title, Manchester City also managed to win the FA Cup and became one of the first ever men's team in England to win the domestic treble. 

**III. Guardiola's Style of Play**

*General*

Guardiola's style of play can be summarized in 5 simple ways:

1. A high percentage of possession

2. A High number of passes completed

3. Push the full-backs into the attack to provide crosses

4. Play possession out from the back 

5. Press and win the ball back quickly when lost in posession 

*Guardiola's Style of Play over The Years*

Below, we will identify key elements to Manchester City's team and how the style of play changed over the different seasons with Pep Guardiola as manager.
  
*2016-2017 Season*

· Pep struggled to find his best XI during the 2016-2017 season and used 8 different formations in 38 Premier League matches. 

· Most often, Manchester City played in a 4-3-3 formation. In this formation, Kevin de Bruyne and David Silva were assigned the "free 8" roles in the midfield, advancing to the 10 positions in possession and drawing back to the defensive midfielder positions in defense.  

· When Manchester City has posession in their own half, the number 6 (Fernandiho) drops in between the two center-backs. Kolarov as a left-footed left center-back was able to distribute the ball to both wingers as he averaged mostlong balls per match for Manchester City during the 2016-2017 season (4.2 long balls on average).

· At Barcelona and Bayern Munich, Pep Guardiola had full-backs who were capable of dominating the entire left and right flank, however, during the 2016-2017 season at Manchester City, Guardiola's full-backs were at age and incapable of fitting into the desired style of play. 

· He there played with a 3-2-5 formation in attack with the two center-backs and the "6" in the back, both full-backs in front of them to secure the midfield, pushing up the number 8's Kevin de Bruyne and Silva into advanced 10 positions in support of the attacking front 3 players. This was done in possession in the opponent's half of the field with the aim to congest the center of the field in order to prevent counterattacks. 

· One of the main challenges in this season was the build up play. Both full-backs who controlled the midfield in possession were not good enough on the ball which slowed down the ball progression and therefore the attack. 

· While facing these challenges, there was overall improvement in the 2016-2017 season as Manchester City scored more goals, had a higher possession percentage, and a higher passing average per game than during the 2015-2016 season with Pellegrini. 

· Ultimately, Manchester City lost in the fourth round of the Carabao Cup, the semi-fianls of the F.A. Cup, and the round of 16 of the Champions League. On top of all of this, they were only able to secure the third place in the Premier League 15 points behind Premier League champion Chelsea. 

*2017-2018 Season*

· With the signings of full-backs Danilo, Benjamin Mendy, and Kyle Walker, Pep Guardiola changed to a 5-3-2 formation. He was able to change from a 4-3-3 formation to a 5-3-2 formation because his full-backs were able to dominate the entire flank and therefore fit better into Guardiola's style of play.

· Due to an early season injury of Mendy (the Manchester City left full-back), Pep Guardiola changed back to the 4-3-3 formation while transforming midfielder Delph into a left-back. 

· New goalkeeper Ederson Moraes became vital in Guardiola's style of play as he was able to comfortably become part of Manchester City's possession game building out from the back as well as play long range passes with extreme precision. This allowed Manchester City to immediately break pressure from the opponent in their own half when needed with Ederson playing a long range pass over the opponent's top allowing their forwards to make penetrating runs behind. 

· In Machester City's build-up play, the full-backs played a key role. Left-back Delph would tuck into the midfield, having a 3-player back line with Walker to the right of the center-back. This allowed Fernandinho to get possession in the midfield instead of dropping in between the two center-backs like he had done during the 2016-2017 season. During the 2017-2018 season, Fernandinho had a sharp increase in his number of passes from 68 to 88 per game and thus dictated Manchester City's build-up play. 

· The Delph and Fernandinho combination in the midfield in possession increased the build up pace compared to the Sagna & Clichy combination in the previous season, one of the many challenges Pep Guardiola faced. At the same time, right-back Kyle Walker had a better understanding of his role as a full-back and was able to determine when to stay as a center-back and when to push higher up to join the attack and be able to cross. 

· Both Kevin de Bruyne and David Silva kept a similar role as in the 2016-2017 season, but now had the ability to come into a position to influence the opponent's midfielders and entire defense line with their play. They were able to choose between a penetrating pass to the wingers behind the opponent's back line, a combination pass with the striker, a cross from the side of the box, or a shot on goal. 

· The key changes to Manchester City's style of play and the new signings that fit into this style of play brought Manchester City a season with historical records:

  - 32 wins (most in Premier League history)
  
  - 16 away wins (most in Premier League history)
  
  - 100 points (most in Premier League history)
  
  - 106 goals (most in Premier League history)
  
  - 19 point title winning margin (biggest in Premier League history)
  
· Manchester City and Pep Guardiola also managed to win the EFL cup during this season, but were knocked out of the Champions League quarterfinal by Premier League opponent, Liverpool.

*2018-2019 Season*

· For this season, Guardiola only signed attacking midfielder Mahrez and kept a very similar first squad compared to the previous season.

· Furthermore, Guardiola made some tweaks to his style of play rather than major changes as his team had become more accustomed to his football philosophy. One of the tweaks he made was the increased involvement of full-backs Kyle Walker and Oleksandr Zinchenko. Zinchenko's speed allowed him to dominate the left flank more consistently than Delph in the previous season. This allowed both Sterling and Sane to play closer to the box with Walker and Zichenko providing the crosses. 

· Injury challenges during this season forced Guardiola to pivot his starting XI and change their style of play. He would often play Fernandiho as a center-back instead of holding midlfielder, the "6" position, and start LaPorte as a left-back instead of a center-back. In possession, Fernandinho would be able to overload the midfield dictating the build-up play with the support of David Silva as Manchester City's centeral midfielder.

· Manchester City continued to dominate the competitions in England as the managed to win the Premier League, Caraboa Cup, and the F.A Cup to become one of the first ever men's team in England to win the domestic treble.

In order to perform the ideal research on Guardiola's impact at Manchester City, we would have liked to perform a analysis on the following variables in addition to our Football Data data set: passes (total), passes per game, pass accuracy %, crosses, cross accuracy %, saves, tackles, tackle success %, blocked shots, interceptions, clearances, duels won, and errors leading to goal. This would allow us to perform a thorough analysis on Guardiola's change in style of play as well as performance during his time as a manager.
